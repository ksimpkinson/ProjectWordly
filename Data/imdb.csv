a very very very slow-moving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man  	 
not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out  	 
attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent  	 
very little music or anything to speak of  	 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head  	 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty  	 
wasted two hours  	 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids  	 
a bit predictable  	 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher  	 
and those baby owls were adorable  	 
the movie showed a lot of florida at it's best made it look very appealing  	 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious  	 
it was so cool  	 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face  	 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see  	 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  	 
i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting post-production editing directing or any other aspect of film-making  	 
"it's practically perfect in all of them â– a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces  	
 the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  	 "
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  	 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  	 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this  	 
it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable  	 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  	 
this short film certainly pulls no punches  	 
graphics is far from the best part of the game  	 
this is the number one best th game in the series  	 
it deserves strong love  	 
it is an insane game  	 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game  	 
waste your money on this game  	 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly  	 
actually the graphics were good at the time  	 
today the graphics are crap  	 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye  	 
this game rocks  	 
buy it play it enjoy it love it  	 
it's pure brilliance  	 
this was a flick doomed from its conception  	 
the very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre pg-13 film and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a pg-rated family movie  	 
i wasn't the least bit interested  	 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer  	 
but it's just not funny  	 
but even the talented carrell can't save this  	 
his co-stars don't fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted  	 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy  	 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work i've ever seen  	 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure  	 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget  	 
i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have  	 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen  	 
it's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl  	 
on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen  	 
long whiny and pointless  	 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go  	 
excellent cast story line performances  	 
totally believable  	 
anne heche was utterly convincing  	 
sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering  	 
i sat riveted to the tv screen  	 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10  	 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor  	 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little  	 
i was very disappointed in the movie  	 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard  	 
there is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene  	 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters  	 
this movie totally grates on my nerves  	 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good  	 
and quite honestly often its not very good  	 
often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings  	 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy - but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly  	 
there are some generally great things in it  	 
i wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time though  	 
the suspense builders were good & just cross the line from g to pg  	 
i especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections  	 
if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice  	 
alexander nevsky is a great film  	 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived  	 
i'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of quã©bec  	 
this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years  	 
if there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote this is it  	 
overall the film is interesting and thought-provoking  	 
plus it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time  	 
give this one a look  	 
i gave it a 10  	 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted  	 
it is a true classic  	 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b-list horror/suspense films go  	 
definitely worth checking out  	 
the problem was the script  	 
it was horrendous  	 
there was nothing believable about it at all  	 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  	 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time  	 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going  	 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip  	 
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church  	 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good music(including a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight) and an uplifting ending give this one a try  	 
i don't think you will be disappointed  	 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad  	 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere  	 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick  	 
too politically correct  	 
very disappointing  	 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful  	 
i love lane but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy  	 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back  	 
but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold  	 
the acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better) and it is a real joy to watch  	 
the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good  	 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a columbo movie before  	 
) and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away  	 
the directing seems too pretentious  	 
the scenes with the oh-so-mature neighbour-girl are a misplace  	 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode  	 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror really stupid  	 
some applause should be given to the prelude however  	 
i really liked that  	 
a great film by a great director  	 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night  	 
the music in the film is really nice too  	 
i'd advise anyone to go and see it  	 
brilliant  	 
10/10  	 
i liked this movie way too much  	 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside  	 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets  	 
however this didn't make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie  	 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  	 
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  	 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding  	 
all in all a great disappointment  	 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film  	 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq  	 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  	 
imdb ratings only go as low   for awful it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these  	
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  	 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict  	 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination  	 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core  	 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  	 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others  	 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly  	 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film  	 
a truly truly bad film  	 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse  	 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder  	 
i paid too much  	 
also it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse  	 
it was so boring  	 
no plot whatsoever  	 
again no plot at all  	 
horrible  	 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh  	 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief  	 
i hate movies like that  	 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked  	 
there is no plot or storyline  	 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out  	 
awful  	 
i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much  	 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid $750 to see this crap  	 
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes)  	 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  	 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things  	 
still i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one  	 
your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation  	 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover  	 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  	 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  	 
i mean this in a terrible way  	 
this film has no redeeming features  	 
everything is appalling  	 
artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie  	 
the story is beyond stupid  	 
the script isâ…was there a script  	 
the kids are annoying  	 
the lead man is charisma-free  	 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture  	 
i'll even say it again â– this is torture  	 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity  	 
not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery  	 
highly unrecommended  	 
if this premise sound stupid that's because it is  	 
yes it's that bad  	 
nothing at all to recommend  	 
an excellent performance from ms  	 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them  	 
it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound  	 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense  	 
there were too many close ups  	 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom  	 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent  	 
"you'll love it  	
this movie is bad  	
so bad  	
the film is way too long  	
this is definitely one of the bad ones  	
the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age  	
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry  	
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him  	
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film  	
i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie  	
i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk  	
it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy  	
another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after  	
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	
his performance is simply genius  	
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire  	 "
" in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	
ray charles is legendary  	
ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	
hitchcock is a great director  	
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch  	
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	
it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy  	
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes  	
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws  	
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture  	
the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy  	
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else  	
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films  	
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it  	
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was  	
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic  	
the character developments also lacked in depth  	
woa talk about awful  	
do not waste your time  	
it was just too horrible  	
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on  	
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction  	
the poor actors  	
you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	
if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance  	
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick  	
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made  	
the film has great actors a master director a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme undertone of fifties existential world-weariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  	
regrettably the film fails  	
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie  	
yet i enjoy watching it  	
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad  	
the dialogue sucked  	
the cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked  	
the soundtrack sucked  	
the acting sucked  	
the concert sequences just sucked  	
that was nice  	
that was funny  	
it was so funny  	
overall this movie was cheap trash  	
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it  	
i came out of it feeling angry  	
***spoilers*** whatever else can (or can't) be said about it surface is superbly crafted  	
the cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art  	
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents kids fantasy and/or fx fans)  	
and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise either; some surprisingly solid casting here  	
all things considered a job very well done  	
thanks good a movie like this was done and released  	
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	
it ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura  	
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film  	
up there with the best of melville  	
everything about this film is simply incredible  	
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  	
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series  	
i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  	
there is a lot of beautiful places  	
it was forced like everything in this movie  	
again lame  	
here's where the movie really pi**ed me off  	
and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork  	
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick  	
summary: the witticisms weren't witty  	
the plot - well i said i'd let that one go  	
the acting was bad  	
really bad  	
even billy bob couldn't rise above the script which was worse  	
camerawork - again bad  	
rating:  out of 10  	
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me  	
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art  	
three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen  	
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	
i couldn't think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art  	
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	
i literally vomited while watching this film  	
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls  	
his performance as awarded was stunning  	
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast  	
i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  	
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap  	
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things)   	
one more thing: i can tolerate political incorrectness very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much  	
this is such a fun and funny movie  	
highly entertaining at all angles  	
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts  	
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous  	
it even has its sweet moments  	
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played  	
and i really did find them funny  	
this is actually a very smart movie  	
there is a brilliant twist ending  	
 i love it  	 "
the ending is so so perfect you'll shed a tear  	 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this  	 
i will never forget it now  	 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic  	 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it  	 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue  	 
this movie is terrible  	 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc  	 
for those that haven't seen it don't waste your time  	 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous  	 
started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters  	 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all  	 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film  	 
the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce  	 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off  	 
glad i didn't pay to see it  	 
didn't laugh or even smile once  	 
but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn  	 
it is a really good show to watch  	 
it is very educational for children   to 8 years old  	
barney is definitely super de duper  	 
is pretty funny  	 
babie bop is very cute  	 
the kids are very cool too  	 
" but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies  	
it's just lame  	
the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  	
everything about this movie is stupid  	
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie  	
it is shameful  	
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could  	
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real  	
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  	
now you know why i gave it a 10+  	
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories  	
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  	
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  	
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  	
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy  	
everything from acting to cinematography was solid  	
definitely worth checking out  	
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen  	
this movie has a cutting edge to it  	
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there  letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him  	
the new characters weren't all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who  	
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever  	
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying  	
the jerky camera movements were also annoying  	
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  	
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot  	
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid  	
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf  	
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget  	
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay  	
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away:)  	
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  	
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing  	
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  	
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back  	
i think the most wonderful parts (literally full of wonder) are the excerpts from his works  	
the sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazingstylized beautiful and effective  	
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer  	
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art  	
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist  	
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history  	
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age  	
) what makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy - and vivid history  	
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless can-do lieutenant roosevelt's big stick  	
this is high adventure at its best  	
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real life(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  	
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt  	
(my mother and brother had to do this)when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed  	
almost all of the songs in cover girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful  	
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal  	
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  	
non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well  	
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful  	
a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  	
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job  	
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs  	
it's a feel-good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema  	
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  	
i rather enjoyed it  	
i liked it  	
i couldn't take them seriously  	
it really created a unique feeling though  	
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script  	
a world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today  	
her role was played well  	
not too screamy not to masculine but just right  	
the camera really likes her in this movie  	
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script  	
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different  	
i am a fan of his  this movie sucked really bad  	
even worse than ticker  	
& that movie was bad  	
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe & poor hummh  	
it just blew  	
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are when:scamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing 'ive never had this feeling before'i totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid  	
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features  	
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda  	
this show is made for americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichã©s to be admitted elsewhere  	
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round  	
i wish i could enter negative values admins  	
the sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode  	
the use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here) no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  	
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too  	
i hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which i really like the star - but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  	
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie  	
in short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film  	
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell  	
/10 - and only because there is no setting for /10  	
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones)  	
the soundtrack wasn't terrible either  	
but the acting--even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon--was terrible the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former) the dialog chimp-like and the camera work barely tolerable  	
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oy-vey scale  	
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation  	
both do good jobs and are quite amusing  	
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance  	
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea we both hated it  	
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  	
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines  	
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie  	
i like armand assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again  	
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends  	
my 8/10 score is mostly for the plot  	
i won't say any more - i don't like spoilers so i don't want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time  	
wow what a bad film  	
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible  	
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling  	
not even good for camp value  	
i wasn't expecting oscar material but this  	
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  	
this film (and i use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public  	
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  	
this gets a  out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower  	
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed  	
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script  	
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable  	
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  	
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the president of the us  	
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving  	
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing  	
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely  	
i was deeply impressed with the character he played  	
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor  	
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow) and some cheesy clichã©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo  	
even the squibs look awful  	
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america  	
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  	
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  	
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all  	
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  	
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words  	
the directing is sloppy at best  	
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing  	
of course the acting is blah  	
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting  	
and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell  	
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other  	
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago  	
this movie contained an all-star cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before  	
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it  	
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a -10 scale  	
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have  	
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning  	
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs  	
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it  	
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way  	
but this movie really got to me  	
see it  	
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style  	
and i forgot: the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvã¥g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesn't understand where he is what he is doing and why  	
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006  	
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting  	
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me  	
later i found myself lost in the power of the film  	
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  	
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race  	
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance  	
the rest of the cast also play well  	
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers  	
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts  	
about half way through this film i started to dislike it  	
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it  	
what this film lacks is a convincing script  	
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  	
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  	
the cast is good  	
for that it's worth checking out  	
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life  	
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen  	
everything about it is just bad  	
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season  	
the script is bad very bad â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc-17 movie  	
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period  	
final word: this show is a real torture  	
it is zillion times away from reality  	
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show  	
rating: /10 (grade: z) note: the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show  	
20th century fox's road house 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie  	
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  	
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical  	
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  	
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  	
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  	
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment  	
there are so many problems i dont know where to start  	
the cast was great  	
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged upper class uptight white guy  	
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well  	
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes  	
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  	
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  	
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character  	
there is no real plot  	
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  	
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  	
this second appearance of mickey mouse (following the silent plane crazy earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking  	
while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  	
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  	
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way  	
clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years  	
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing  	
i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there  	
the original body and soul (1947) is a masterpiece  	
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe  	
i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake  	
this may be the only bad film he ever made  	
so badwellit's just bad  	
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way  	
it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this  	
i thought it was bad  	
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable  	
let's start with all the problemsâ—the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad  	
the script is a big flawed mess  	
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  	
director paul matthews who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films  	
the movie is terribly boring in places  	
the lighting is awful  	
the film looks cheap and bland  	
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  	
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here  	
the visual effects were awful  	
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake  	
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  	
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so i'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool  	
gotta love those close-ups of slimy drooling teeth  	
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  	
not recommended  	
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing  	
aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits  	
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  	
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg-13 rating certainly won't allow  	
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim)  	
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer  	
the budget was evidently very limited  	
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the below-par script which borrowed much from the earlier classic  	
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up  	
filmiing was less expansive  	
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original  	
generally; it just lacked imagination  	
not recommended  	
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this  	
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place  	
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep  	
beware: this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash -period  	
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this  	
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review  	
being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons  	
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created  	
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  	
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers)  	
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  	
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead  	
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  	
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk  	
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  	
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done  	
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie  	
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles  	
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  	
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense  	
the story line is just awful  	
it's just painful  	
and the accents are absolutely abysmal  	
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  	
don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film  	
i believe that pitch black was done well  	
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it  	
go watch it  	
omit watching this  	
very funny  	
my rating: just 3 out of 10  	
the characters are interesting and you really care for them  	
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  	
don't miss it  	
this is a masterful piece of film-making with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more  	
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it)  	
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close-up camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold  	
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work  	
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  	
regardless the film fails on most levels  	
avoid at all costs  	
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was  	
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor  	
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic  	
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child  	
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was  	
i'll give this film 10 out of 10  	
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull  	
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests  	
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  	
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white low-budget original  	
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable  	
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  	
excellently produced by one of sci-fi's best producers scot vandiver   	
but it is entertaining nonetheless  	
it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch  	
there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts  	
the cast is always entertaining as usual  	
overall a delight  	
this movie is so mind-bendingly awful it couldn't have even been created  	
the film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  	
the least said about the acting the better  	
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa  	
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process  	
nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film  	
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see  	
don't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  	
excellent performance  	
there still are good actors around  	
also great directing and photography  	
very true to shakespear and a 'must' for all shakespear fans  	
macbeth (jason connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle out)he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting  	
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil  	
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one  	
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award  	
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  	
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb & complex  	
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar  	
even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series) this is baaaaaad  	
unless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of austen's work you can skip this one  	
if you do watch it however there are small consolations: the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles  	
it is not good  	
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy  	
then the film just dropped the ball  	
this is a stunning movie  	
raw and sublimely moving  	
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  	
all of the main players are mesmerising  	
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike  	
julian fellowes has triumphed again  	
he's a national treasure  	
go and see it  	
this is an excellent film  	
the aerial scenes were well-done  	
it was also the right balance of war and love  	
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few  	 "
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference  	 
a good film by a great director  	 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage  	 
there are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage joe's glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene  	 
this is just a great movie  	 
10 out of 10 stars  	 
i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection  	 
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason  	 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema  	 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other  	 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films  	 
i advise you to look out for it  	 
you wont regret it  	 
highly recommended a+  	 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is  	 
it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage  	 
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'  	 
) very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time  	 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes  	 
how awful she is  	 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures  	 
the results well are a shame  	 
delete this film from your mind  	 
one of the worst shows of all time  	 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for  	 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the bad-ass girl who are these actors  	 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part  	 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show  	 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors  	 
lame would be the best way to describe it  	 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility  	 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character  	 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem  	 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any self-respecting rpger there is  	 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong  	 
you can find better movies at youtube  	 
top line: don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes  	 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever  	 
that's how i'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film  	 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen  	 
it isn't even an achievement as a so-bad-it's-good or so-bad-it's-memorable movie  	 
it's an empty hollow shell of a movie  	 
seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on  	 
avoid avoid avoid  	 
it will drive you barking mad  	 
the transfers are very good  	 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing  	 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title  	 
) some great music and terrific scenery  	 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has (shocking spoiler here  	 
) a happy wonderful feel good ending  	 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family  	 
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized  	 
nothing new there  	 
that was done in the second movie  	 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy  	 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted  	 
what on earth is irons doing in this film  	 
i just saw this film and i recommend it  	 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good  	 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love  	 
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering  	 
emily watson's character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything  	 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie  	 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat (stuart townsend) better than cruise's attempt  	 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene)  	 
i'm a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rice's style sensitivities and treatments  	 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable  	 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing  	 
but i thought his acting was skilled  	 
meredith m was better than all right  	 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart  	 
it is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  	 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film  	 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre  	 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's  	 
a standout scene  	 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant  	 
technically the film is well made with impressive camera-work solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill  	 
it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema  	 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end  	 
i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son  	 
this movie is also revealing  	 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue  	 
and it was boring  	 
i am so tired of clichã©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast  	 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  	 
it's a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect  	 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right  	 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  	 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself  	 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  	 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard  	 
you won't forget this movie  	 
why was this film made  	 
the film has an ultra-cheap look to it  	 
the result is a film that just don't look right  	 
none of them are engaging or exciting  	 
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  	 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time  	 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it  	 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr  	 
this movie is so awesome  	 
i loved it it was really scary  	 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there  	 
if you want a real scare rent this one  	 
10/10  	 
this is an extraordinary film  	 
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening  	 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court  	 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen  	 
this mostly routine fact-based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole  	 
predictable but not a bad watch  	 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part  	 
she carries the movie well  	 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations  	 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd  	 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcit's all wrong  	 
in fact this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release  	 
avoid at all costs  	 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series  	 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  	 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god (seriously) i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards  	 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage  	 
the worst one of the series  	 
editing: the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion  	 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions  	 
cinematography: the film was shot in an interesting way  	 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film  	 
this film offers many delights and surprises  	 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film  	 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch  	 
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor  	 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression  	 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop  	 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars  	 
the acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch  	 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic  	 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violin-playing anatomist doctor quinn  	 
conclusion - i loved it  	 
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie  	 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it  	 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line  	 
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  	 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  	 
plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job  	 
juano hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south  	 
trumbull on i love lucy)  	 
see it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years  	 
see both films if you can  	 
"it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead  	
feelings thoughtsgabriel's discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal  	
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  	
it's very slow  	
lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  	
) don't waste your time  	
end of days is one of the worst big-budget action movies i've ever seen  	
he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money  	
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen  	
i'm still trying to get over how bad it was  	
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever  	
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the be-all end-all of brainsucking movies look no further  	
 with great sound effects and impressive special effects i can't recommend this movie enough  	 "
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever  	 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	 
  hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	
lots of holes in the script  	 
it's like a bad two hour tv movie  	 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	 
the dialogue is atrocious  	 
the acting is beyond abysmal  	 
everything stinks  	 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	 
worse there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	 
it's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time  	 
in short don't bother with this movie  	 
i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it  	 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame  	 
a film not easily forgotten  	 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman â– and totally believable because he is a great actor  	 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years  	 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable  	 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	 
great movie  	 
also the story and acting were weak  	 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasn't  	 
either way it sucks  	 
the script is horrendously stupid  	 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest  	 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid  	 
what the hell kind of crap is that  	 
then there's the plot holes  	 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	 
she's poised and amazing  	 
dee snider just plain sucks  	 
he can't act (one of the least scary villains i have ever seen) he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep  	 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  	 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably  	 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid  	 
avoid at any and all costs  	 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	 
avoid this film at all costs  	 
i don't know what happened in season five what a mess  	 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	 
now this is a movie i really dislike  	 
it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	 
the puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks  	 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets  	 
there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible  	 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs  	 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams  	 
the best part about nurse betty is it's unpredictability  	 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next  	 
otherwise don't even waste your time on this  	 
this one just fails to create any real suspense  	 
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  	 
there is however some pretty good acting (at least for this type of film)  	 
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone  	 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen  	 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  	 
hated it  	 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad  	 
i don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie  	 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash  	 
this is not movie-making  	 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is  	 
so i am here to warn you--do not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen  	 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it  	 
i didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes  	 
excellent short film  	 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film  	 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad  	 
characters are one-dimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys  	 
the story line is totally predictable  	 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture  	 
i've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  	 
bad characters bad story and bad acting  	 
really awful  	 
not easy to watch  	 
funny clever hip - just like pray's previous film hype  	 
it was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen  	 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years  	 
the movie is not completely perfect but 'titta di girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie  	 
i rate this movie 9/10  	 
i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye  	 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie  	 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord  	 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience  	 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems  	 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen  	 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with  	 
this movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts  	 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful  	 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times  	 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie  	 
this is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it  	 
go rent it  	 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again  	 
it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings  	 
brilliance indeed  	 
but if you liked movies like the matrix (and better yet their sequels) i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you  	 
think of the film being like a dream  	 
simply beautiful  	 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe-- has written a subversive tract  	 
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver  	 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  	 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic  	 
it's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess  	 
the movie seemed a little slow at first  	 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point  	 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget  	 
i enjoyed it  	 
i have recommended it to friends  	 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz  	 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance  	 
their on-screen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine  	 
the film's dialogue is natural real to life  	 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate  	 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film  	 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters  	 
definitely worth seeingâ… it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness  	 
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo (ponyo on the cliff by the sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  	 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney/pixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories  	 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film  	 
the art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful  	 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible  	 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (deep impact and armageddon) and this one fails everywhere  	 
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  	 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  	 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses  	 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting  	 
then i watched it again two sundays ago (march 20th 2005) and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing  	 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie  	 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film  	 
i keep watching it over and over  	 
it's a sad movie but very good  	 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it  	 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie  	 
still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow  	 
;) recommend with confidence  	 
this movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself  	 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming darren (tom hollander)  	 
:) anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot  	 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch  	 
fans of the genre will be in heaven  	 
lange had become a great actress  	 
it looked like a wonderful story  	 
i never walked out of a movie faster  	 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off  	 
unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script  	 
in a word it is embarrassing  	 
exceptionally bad  	 
all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money
